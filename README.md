In this analysis, our spotlight will be on the powerful RFM framework â€“ Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. RFM analysis is a strategic approach that enables businesses to understand and segment their customer base based on their recent transactional behavior, purchase frequency, and monetary contribution.

The Essence of RFM Analysis Recency (R): Shining a light on the temporal aspect, Recency evaluates how recently a customer made a purchase. It provides a glimpse into customer engagement and loyalty.

Frequency (F): Frequency explores the number of transactions a customer has conducted. It unveils insights into customer loyalty and the habitual nature of purchasing.

Monetary Value (M): Monetary Value signifies the total amount a customer has spent. It showcases the economic contribution of each customer to the business.

Unraveling Customer Segmentation Through RFM analysis, we aim to segment customers into distinct groups, each with its unique characteristics and behaviors. This segmentation will empower us to tailor marketing strategies, enhance customer experiences, and identify high-value segments deserving special attention.
